# Rental House FastAPI

⚠ **Status: Abandoned / Incomplete.**

This project was an experimental back-end service for managing rental properties, built
by `FastAPI`. The goal was to explore proper `API Design`,
`Architecture and Design Patterns`, and learning new tools such as `celery` and `redis`.

## Intended features

- User Authentication and Authorization
- Property and unit management
- Data analytics and pipelines

## Project status

Abandoned due to shifting priorities and time constraints. This is not production-ready
and it should not be treated as a learning prototype.

## What have I learnt for managing my time on side projects?

- Make small time every day or every other day so the project doesn't left behind.
- Don't over-engineer things at the start.
